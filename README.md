### Overview 
<p>The Sort Manager Project is a Java program that allows a user to sort a randomised 
array.</p>
<p>The user is presented with a choice of sort algorithms as well as their desired array length. </p>

### Input
<p>The program takes an input of `1`
to run, or any other key to exit.</p>
<p>When the program runs, the program takes an input of `1`, `2`, `3` or `4` to choose between:
```
<ol>
    <li>BinaryTree sort</li>
    <li>Bubble sort</li>
    <li>Insertion Sort</li>
    <li>Quick sort</li>
</ol>
```
</p>
<p>When the program finishes, the user is taken back to the main menu: `Enter 1 to run, 0 to exit`. </p>

### Output 
<p>The program outputs a random unsorted array,
a sorted array with the user's choice of algorithm, and the time taken for the algorithm to execute (in nanoseconds).</p>

### Tools
<p>Apache Maven build automation</p>
<p>JUnit unit testing framework</p>
<p>GitBash CLI</p>
